# metabase_table (Data Source)

A Metabase table, part of a parent database.

This data source can be useful to find the Metabase ID of a table based on the table name. Table IDs are required when creating cards (questions) and other resources.

Metabase also assigns an ID to each field (column) in the table. Those are also useful to define dashboard filters for example.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# This finds a table using the ID of the parent database, the table name, and the table schema (dataset for BigQuery).
# At least one attribute must be set, but they are all optional.
data "metabase_table" "table_by_name" {
  db_id  = 2 # Or use `metabase_database.db.id`.
  name   = "table_name"
  schema = "schema"
}

# Although less useful, a table can be found by its ID if it's already known.
data "metabase_table" "table_by_id" {
  id = 1
}

output "table_id" {
  value = data.metabase_table.table_by_name.id
}

# The ID of each column can be found using the `fields` attribute, which is a map between column names and field IDs.
output "field_id" {
  value = data.metabase_table.table_by_name.fields["column_name"]
}

output "table_name" {
  value = data.metabase_table.table_by_id.name
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `db_id` (Number) The ID of the parent database.
- `entity_type` (String) The type of table.

- `name` (String) The name of the table.
- `schema` (String) The database schema in which the table is located. For BigQuery, this is the dataset name.

### Read-Only

- `description` (String) A description for the table.
- `display_name` (String) The name displayed in the interface for the table.
- `fields` (Map of Number) A map where keys are field (column) names and values are their Metabase ID.
