# metabase_permissions_graph (Data Source)

A data source for reading the current Metabase permissions graph.

This data source is useful when managing permissions across multiple Terraform workspaces or when you want to read the current state of permissions without modifying them.

Unlike the resource, this data source only reads the permissions graph and does not make any changes to Metabase.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Read the current database permissions graph.
# This is useful when managing permissions across multiple Terraform workspaces.
data "metabase_permissions_graph" "current" {}

# You can specify groups to ignore when reading the graph.
# By default, the Administrators group (ID 2) is ignored.
data "metabase_permissions_graph" "with_options" {
  ignored_groups       = [2]
}

output "revision" {
  value = data.metabase_permissions_graph.current.revision
}

output "permissions" {
  value = data.metabase_permissions_graph.current.permissions
}
```
