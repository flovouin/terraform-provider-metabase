# metabase_table (Resource)

An existing Metabase table, part of a parent database.

This resource never creates or deletes tables, as they are managed by Metabase itself. However the table and its fields can be updated.

Instead of being created, the table will be looked up based on its id or a combination of (db_id, name, entity_type, and/or schema). The unspecified attributes will be filled with the values from Metabase's response.

Like its data source counterpart, this resource exposes the ID of the fields (columns) in the table.

The display name and the description of the table can be set. If not specified, the remote values are available instead.

Finally, this resource may define the semantic type for all or a subset of the fields (columns) using the forced_field_types attribute. Only the fields in the map will be updated, all other fields are left as is.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# This **imports** a table using the ID of the parent database, the table name, and the table schema (dataset for
# BigQuery). At least one attribute must be set, but they are all optional.
resource "metabase_table" "table_by_name" {
  db_id  = 2 # Or use `metabase_database.db.id`.
  name   = "table_name"
  schema = "schema"

  # Optional read/write attributes that will be imported from Metabase if not specified.
  description  = "🗃️ Some very important data."
  display_name = "💮 My Table"

  # Each field (column) in this map will have its semantic type updated with the corresponding value.
  # Any field in the table not specified here will be left untouched.
  forced_field_types = {
    column_1 = null            # "No semantic type".
    column_2 = "type/Category" # "Category".
  }
}

# Although less useful, a table can be imported by its ID if it's already known.
resource "metabase_table" "table_by_id" {
  id = 1
}

# The ID of each column can be found using the `fields` attribute, which is a map between column names and field IDs.
output "field_id" {
  value = metabase_table.table_by_name.fields["offer"]
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `db_id` (Number) The ID of the parent database. If specified, it is used to find the existing table.
- `description` (String) A description for the table.
- `display_name` (String) The name displayed in the interface for the table.
- `entity_type` (String) The type of table. If specified, it is used to find the existing table.
- `forced_field_types` (Map of String) A map where keys are field (column) names and values are Metabase semantic types. Not all fields have to be specified.
- `id` (Number) The ID of the table. If specified, the `db_id`, `name`, `entity_type`, and `schema` should not be specified.
- `name` (String) The name of the table. If specified, it is used to find the existing table.
- `schema` (String) The database schema in which the table is located. For BigQuery, this is the dataset name. If specified, it is used to find the existing table.

### Read-Only

- `fields` (Map of Number) A map where keys are field (column) names and values are their Metabase ID.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# Use the integer ID from the Metabase API.
terraform import metabase_table.table 1
```
